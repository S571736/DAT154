## Windows SDK
* Based on functions
  * Not object oriented
* Can make object oriented programs by creating ovjects that encapsulate functions
* Uses normally C and C++....

### Windows messages
* The windows OS is based on messages
  * Sends messages to programs when events occur
  * Messages are out into the message queue
  * Message loop in program retrieves messages and handles the message
* Message handling example
  1. Mouse click
  2. Mouse driver
  3. I/O manager
  4. User32
  5. Message queue
  6. WinMain
  7. User32
  8. WndProc


### Pointers, SDK Deci(?)
**Compact C/C++ notations**

````c++
int tab[] = {0,1,2,3,5,8,-1}
int* pi = tab;
while({)*++pi != -1){
    cout << *pi << ',';
}
cout << endl;
````

**Pointers and functions**
````c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Double(int* pi)
{
    int tall = *pi;
    tall = tall * 2;
    *pi = tall;
}

int main()
{
int n;
cout << "Enter n : ";
cin >> n;
Double(&n);
cout << "n x 2 = : " << n << endl;
}
````

**Dynamic variables** must always be deleted

````c++
int main(){
    X a("Hello");
    X* pb= new X("World");
    
    a.Print();
    pb -> Print();
    delete pb;
}
````
### C#

````C#
class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(){
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
}
````
### Compile
````
csc /target:exe helloworld.cs
````

### .NET components
* Common language runtime(CLR)
  * Kernel, Required to run CIL code
* Framework class library(FCL)
  * Contains 6000+ classes for use in .NET library(replaces API calls)
* Compilers
  * Create assemblies containing CIL to run on the CLR
  
### Namespaces
* A namespace is a way to organize .NET classes
* A namespace groups together classes with similar functions
* A namespace also makes it easier to avoid duplicate class names
* All the classes in the FCL are divided into namespaces based on their functionality
* A class is identified by both its namespace and actual name
* When we use a class, we need to tell the compiler both the namespace and the name of the class
* Examples:
  * ``System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World);``
  * ``Library.Book book = new Library.Book("Title");``
  
#### Namespaces - Importing
* For  commonly used namespaces, we can import the namespace by using the using directive
* Example:
````c#
using System;
class CelloWorld {
    public static void Main(){
        Console.WriteLine("Cello World");
    }
}
````
#### Namespaces - creating
* A namespace is created by wrapping our class(es) in a namespace block

#### Namespaces - nesting
* Namespaces can be nested
* The using keyword does not provide access to namespaces nested below the specified level
  
#### Namespaces - aliases
* One can use aliases to provide a simplified name for a class or namespace
````c#
using s = System; // Namespace alias
using c = System.Console; // Class alias

s::Console.WriteLine();
c.WriteLine();
````

### References
* References points to external libraries
* By default, not everything is referenced from a project.
* Might need to set up a reference to access a given namespace.
* References can be browsed in the object browser in VS

### Managed Code
* Managed code is code that targets the CLR
* Code that does not target the CLR(old DLL's...) is unmanaged code
* Managed code is handled by the CLR, that provides
  * Security checks
  * Memory Management/Garbage Collection
  * Access to managed data

### Assemblies
* An assembly is a .NET library or executable with the following properties:
  * Contains IL code which is compiled .NET source for example C# or VB.NET
  * Contains metadata which describes the interface.
  
### Libraries

### Value Types vs Reference types
* .NET has two kind of types
  * Value Types
  * Reference types
  
### Reference types
* Reference types are stored on the heap
* A pointer to the memory location occupied by the type is store on the stack


### Value types
* A value type does not point to the heap, it kepps its value on the stack*
* When assigned to a new variable, the content is copied
* Still behaves as an Object, and has methods
* Implicit inheretance from System.ValueType
  
### Boxing
* Boxing is the process that happens then a Value Type is encapsulated in a Reference Type, and placed on the stack
* This creates a new copy of the value type
* Using a non-generics data structudre causes all Value Types to be boxed(And needs to be unboxed upon retrieval)
* Boxing is a resource intensive
* When using a data structure that supports generics, Boxing does not take place

### REP: Common intermediate Language
* Visual Studio does not let us mix different languages in the same VS project
* But it is possible to create different projects inside a solution, where each project uses its own language
* It is also possible to manually assemble the .NET modules into .NET assemblies
* All .NET code no matter the language are compile to CIL code
* Possible to use several different .NET languages in the same project
* One language can use or subclass classes written in another language
* One language can throw an exception that is caught in another language

### Subclasses
* As seem subclasses across languages
* This is written the exact same way as you would extend a native class
* Just remember to import the required namespaces(There might be implicit namespaces in the foreign language)
  
### Compiling
* Normally, when code is compiled with a .NET compiler, we get a standalone assembly, which contains
  * Metadata
  * Executable CIL code
* Linking, as known from C++ is normally no longer done manually, but done automatically at runtime.

### Demo - IL code similarity
* IL code output will be similar for similar code, no matter the original language
* Differences are due to compiler handling
* Note that some languages might lack some features, so writing identical code in two languages might not always be possible

### What is software architecture
* Create a design that ensures 
  * Usability
    * Business requirements
    * Performance
  * Stability
  * Maintainability
    * Bug fixing
    * Changing requirements
  * Security
* Three participants
  * User
  * Business
  * System
* Conflicts
  * Tradeoffs
* Must identify and consider key scenarios and quality attributes

### Key Architecture Principles
* Build to change instead of build to last
* Model to analyze and reduce risk
* Use models and visualizations as a communication and collaboration tool
* Identify key engineering decisions

### Delegate
* A delegate is a list of function pointers
* When called, a delegate will call all the function pointers it contains
* A delegate can be used to control program flow dynamically, since pointers can be added or removed at runtime
* Allows for a clear separation of modules, the owner of the delegate does not need to know about or depend upon the modules subscribing to the delegate
  
### Patterns
* A pattern is a predefined solution to a common problem
* Patterns are found in all areas of creativity - Architecture, electronics, crafts, software design, software architecture
* Documented and published
  
### Architectural Patterns
* Also referred to as Architectural Styles
* Provides an abstract framework
* ...
  
### Client/Server
* Distributed system
  * Both the client and the server holds part of the applivation
* Clients are typically concerned about UI, while the server takes care of the business logic
* Clients make requests, server fulfills them
* Multiple clients may use one server

### Scenarios
* Web application
* Mail/messaging systems
* Collaboration software
* Banking system
* Remote database access
  * Always?

### Advantages
* Security
* Centralization data access
* Ease of maintenance

### Disadvantages
* Scalability
* Stability 

### What is LinQ?
* Language Integrateed Query
* LinQ is a Query language designed to query in memory data, databases, XML and other data sources
* Similar to SQL
* Works with all data structures implementing he IEnumerable interface

````c#
public class test
{


  static void Main(string[] args)
  {

    List<String> ls = new List<String>()
    {
      "Bob",
      "Alice",
      "Oscar",
      "Mike"
    };
    foreach(var x in ls.OrderBy(x=> x))
    {
      Console.WriteLine(x);
    }

    Console.ReadKey();
  }
}
````

### IEnumerable
* A collection class implementing this interface can be iterated over with a foreach statement, as well as queried by something
* GetEnumerator uses the ``yield`` keyword to return elements one by one
* Normally done inside a loop
* Looks like a return statement, but does not end the method on invocation

````c#
namespace IEnumerable
{
  public class SimpleCollector<T> : IEnumerable<T> // Vil automatisk lage noen metoder, kopierer de fra forelesning som har noe Ã¥ si
  {
    private list<T> data = new List<T>();

    public void Add(T item)
    {
      data.Add(item);  
    }

    public T Get(T index)
    {
      return data.ElementAt(index);
    }

    public IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator()
    {
      foreach(T x in data)
      {
        yield return x;
      }
    }
  }

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      SimpleCollection<string> sc = new SimpleCollection<string>();

      sc.Add("Hei");
      sc.Add("Hello");

      foreach(string s in sc)
      {
        Console.WriteLine(s); // Will cause errors due to SimpleCollection list being private
      }

      Console.ReadKey();


    }
  }
}
````

### Using LINQ
* To use LINQ we must include the System.Linq namespace
* This adds appropriate extension methods to all classes implementing the IEnumerable interface
* These extension methods provides functionality for running queries on the collection object
* Some important methods:
  * Select
  * Where 
  * OrderBy
  * GroupBy
  * Join


### The ``DbSet<T>`` class
* The ``DbSet<T>`` class is a collection of entity classes, and represents a physical table in your database
* A table can be loaded from the database simply by calling the Set<> method on the DbContext 

### Step 1 - We need entity classes
* Entity classes can be manually created as outlined previously using ADO.NET
* Or they can be automatically generated by Visual Studio

### ASP.NET
* ASP.NET uses .NET technology to create web application
* Can theoretically be written in any .NET language, but usually c# or VB.NET is used
* Uses HTML for presentation

### ASP.NET API's 
* Web Forms
* MVC
* Web API

### ASP Tags
* THe HTML file uses special ``<asp>`` tags to represent .NET controls and other special elements.
* In code, these behaves just like ordinary .NET controls
* These are precessed server-side before the HTML code is sent to the client

### Testing and Debugging
* Testing adn debugging is done using the built in webserver in Visual Studio
* You can use breakpoints and watches just as with a local applicaiton
* Note that the browser might time out during a debugging session. This doesn't affect the debugging session itself, but you would not get any new data

### Microsoft MVC
* Based on ASP.NET
* Uses the familiar Model-View-Controller pattern
  * Seperates data from logic from presentation
* Uses Razor for creating dynamic html pages
  * Code blocks and inline expressions are indicated by @
  * Code blocks can be C# or VB
* Uses routing to determine which controller and method will handle a request
  * Decoupled, easy to add additional functionality

### WebAPI
* ADO.NET API for making restful webservices
  * REST(Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style
    * Based on stateless operation
    * Decoupled architecture
    * Not limited to a fixed data format, but JSON is often used
    * URI's contain resource identification
    * BASED on HTTP, uses HTTP verbs
* Built on top of the Microsoft MVC web platform
* Serves data in the format requested by the client(XML or JSON, for HTML use MVC)
  * Marshalled automatically

### Universal Windows Platform(UWP)
* Platform built on top of the WIndows Runtime(WinRT)
* Designed to run on all modern Windows devices:
  * Windows 10
  * Xbox
  * Surface Hub
  * Hololens
  * Windows Phone/Mobile
* Can be developed in C#/VB/C++/JavaScript
* Does not have to be .NET
* Does not support the full .NET ecosystem
* Not intended for non-Windows OS
  * Use Xamarin
* Distributed bia Microsoft Store
  * Also sideload support
* UI options similar to WPF
* Secure Execution
* Limited support for ADO.NET
* Optimized for touch scenarios

### Lambda Expressions
* While normal expressions return a value, a lambda expressoin will return a method
* This is particularly useful when designing anonymous methods to use with delegates/events
* Lambda expressions allow us to bring functional programming into .NET

### Defining Lambda Expression
* A lambda expression has these elements
  * A list of parameters
  * The ``=>`` operator
  * The method body (Or a simple expression)
* ``(param) => {body;}``

### Expression/Statement Lambda
* Lambda statements are divided into expression and statement lambdas
  * An expression lambda is a one line statement, without brackets. The result of the expression is used as the return value.
  * A Statement lambda contains a body in brackets, needed if the lambda is multiline. An explicit return statement is used to return a value.
* Note that the term lambda expression still refers to both types

### Using lambda expressions
* Lambda expressions are pointers to functions
  * Not immediately evaluated
* Normally stored in a delegate
  * Custom defined delegate
  * ``Func<in T1, ..., in Tn, out T>``
  * ``Action<in T1, ..., in Tn>``

### Sample lambda expressions
* ``x => x*x``
* ``x => {return x*x;}``
* ``() => timer.start()``
* ``(x,y) => {x += y; return x/y;}``
* ``(int x) = x/2``

### Out of scope variables
* A lambda expression can refer to a variable that is no longer in scope when the function is called
  * The expression will still have access to this variable
  * The variable will only be garbage collected when the delegate holding the lambda collected

### Dynamic program flow
* Lambda expressions are great for controlling program flow
* They can be created in one part of the applications and passed to another
* This allows for more dynamic control of a program flow at runtime

### Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)
* Many LINQ operations benefits from being run in parallel
* This allows the computer to put multiple threads at work processing the data
* Just start the LINQ chain with a call to ``AsParallel()``
* Not all data/operations can be optimized for parallel processing
* Beware thread safety
* Many configuration options (parallelism, ordering, custom partitioning, etc)

### Parallel Execution
* Parallel for loops:
  * Allows us to do multiple loop iterations in parallel instead of one by one sequentially
  * ``Parallel.For(int, int, Action<int>)``
  * ``Parallel.ForEach(IEnumerable<t>, Action<t>)``
* Parallel delegates:
  * ``Parallel.Invoke(Action[])``
  * Note: Operates on an array of delegatesm does not parallelize each individual delegate
### Asynchronous Processing
* Running a method asynchronous 


### UI Design/UX/Universal Design
* Note that this is a big topic
  * We will only be looking at the surface
* **GOAL** - Usability
* The design should be 
  * Easy to use by everyone
  * Easy to understand by everyone
    * Text should be understandable
    * Elements should be identifiable
    * Icons/images should be meaningful

### Do your research
* When designing a user interface, ALWAYS research your target audience and map their needs and requirements based on principples for good UI design
* Do NOT give your own opinions much weight. An interface suited for a developer is not going to be well suited for the majority of users unless you design an IDE.
* DO test the UI on users
  * Mock ups is often a good start
  * Focus groups
* Consider getting professional help, UX is a whole field of study, not the job of a lone developer. UD is not simple either. 

### Meet Expectiations

* When someone use a given computer system, they have expectations
  * Windows layout and design
  * Control placement
  * Key Bindings
  * Colors
* Comply with the standard look & feel on their platform
* Make sure to use system colors so that the color scheme of your application follows the user settings
* Make sure the application obeys changes to the system properties, like font size
* If the platform supports skinning, make sure your application also uses the skins properly

### Visuals

* Remember that not everyone have 20/20 vision
  * Near/far-sighted, colorbling, blind, injuries, illness.
* By following the advice about meeting, something something
* Use Colors with high contrast values
* Remember color blindness
  * Not everyone sees all colors the same way
* Try to use standard window layout, for most programs, this means menu/toolbakr at the top, dialog buttons at the bottom, og der forsvant tekste

### Content

* Think about internationalization and Localization
  * This may even impact the design (ex: right-to-left readers)
  * Remember that texts may be longer in other languages than yours
* Beware the use of symbols
  * Not friendly to screen readers
  * Culurally dependent
  * Some symbols are taught, others are natural
    * What's natural to you might not be to others
  
### Readability

* Don't try to put too much detain into one page/window so on

### Sensible navigation

* People hav edifferent control preferences, like mouse, keyboard, touch, etc. Others have special needs
  * Let people use their preferred equipment.
* Make sure the navigation path trough your application is sensible
  * TEST
* Make navigational elements obvious

### Sound, Video and visuals

### Robustness

* The design should be able to handle user errors gracefully, without breaking
* User errors should not have major consequences
  * Confirmatino
  * Undo
  * Autosave
